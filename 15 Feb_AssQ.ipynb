    "In Python, both multithreading and multiprocessing are used to achieve multitasking, i.e., the execution of multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
    "However, they have some key differences¹²³⁴:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concurrency vs Parallelism**: Multithreading achieves concurrency, meaning it gives the illusion of running in parallel, but\n",
    "actually, the threads are run in a concurrent manner¹. On the other\n",
    "hand, multiprocessing achieves parallelism, where multiple processes are run across multiple CPU cores¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents threads from running simultaneously¹. This \n",
    "is not an issue in multiprocessing as each process has a separate GIL and instance of a Python interpreter³.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Space**: Threads within the same process share the same memory space¹, while each process in multiprocessing has its own memory\n",
    "space¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases**: Multithreading is great for I/O-bound tasks that require concurrency, such as web scraping or reading and writing files²⁴.\n",
    "Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks that require parallelism, such as computations or data processing⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Overhead**: Creating a new thread is less costly than creating a new process¹. Context switching between threads in the same process\n",
    "is also less costly than switching between processes¹.\n",
