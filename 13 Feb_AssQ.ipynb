    "In Python, when creating a custom exception, we typically inherit from the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.\n",
    "This is because the `Exception` class is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. Here's why we do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inheritance**: By inheriting from the `Exception` class, our custom exception automatically gets all the behaviors \n",
    "and attributes of standard Python exceptions. This includes the ability to use our custom exception in a `try/except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Polymorphism**: When we catch exceptions using a `try/except` block, Python allows us to catch all exceptions that \n",
    "inherit from a certain base class in the same `except` block. If our custom exception inherits from the `Exception` class,\n",
    "it can be caught using `except Exception:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Best Practices**: It's considered good practice to inherit from `Exception` or its subclasses when creating a custom exception.\n",
